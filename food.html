    <h2>5. Japan</h2>

    <p><strong>Japanese apply the same precision to their food as they do to their engineering. This is the place that spawned tyrannical sushi masters and ramen bullies who make their staff and customers tremble with a glare.</strong></p>

    <h2>4. Spain</h2>

    <p><strong>The Spaniards gourmandize the way they flamenco dance, with unbridled passion. They munch on snacks throughout the day with intervals of big meals. From the fruits of the Mediterranean Sea to the spoils of the Pyrenees,
       from the saffron and cumin notes of the Moors to the insane molecular experiments of Ferran Adria, Spanish food is timeless yet avant garde.</strong></p>

  <h2>3. France</h2>

  <p><strong>If you're one of those people who doesn't like to eat because "there's more to life than food" -- visit Paris. It's a city notorious for its curmudgeonly denizens, but they all believe in the importance of good food. Two-hour lunch breaks for three-course meals are de rigeur.</strong></p>

    <h2>2. Mexico</h2>

    <p><strong>If you were only allowed to eat the food of one country the rest of your life, it would be smart to make it Mexico. The cuisine of the Mesoamerican country has a little bit of everything -- you'll never get bored.</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Italy</h2>
    <img src="images/italy.jpg" alt="Italy's food item">
    <p><strong>Italian food has enslaved tastebuds around the globe for centuries, with its zesty tomato sauces, those clever things they do with wheat flour and desserts that are basically vehicles for cream. It's all so simple. Get some noodles, get some olive oil, get some garlic, maybe a
       tomato or a slice of bacon. Bam, you have a party on a plate. And it is all so easy to cook and eat.</strong></p>
